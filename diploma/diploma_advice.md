# Diploma & Survival Guide (Based on Maria's Advice)

This guide aggregates advice regarding the final year, specifically focusing on the diploma process, course specifics, and survival tips.

## 📅 Diploma Timeline & Process

### 1. Topic & Supervisor Selection (October - November)
*   **Deadline:** Mid-to-late November.
*   **Advice:**
    *   **Do not** take the default topics offered by the department unless you want a strict supervisor and a boring topic.
    *   **Strategy:** Look at the archive of past theses (available on the university website/Mano). Find supervisors who have supervised topics similar to what you want (e.g., Software vs. Hardware).
    *   **Approach:** Email potential supervisors directly. "Hello, I have this idea..."
    *   **Topic Type:** You can choose **Research** or **Development**. Most students (and this guide) focus on **Development**.
    *   **Software vs. Hardware:** Computer Engineering often pushes for hardware. If you want pure software, you need to fight for it or find a supervisor who supports it (check archives).

### 2. Objectives & Requirements (December)
*   **Deadline:** End of December.
*   **Deliverable:** A formal document approved by the department.
*   **Importance:** **Critical**. This defines your grading criteria.
    *   If you list a requirement, you *must* show it in your final system.
    *   **Do not** generate this blindly with ChatGPT.
    *   Hard to change later (requires bureaucracy).

### 3. BD1 - Bachelor Defense 1 (January)
*   **Timing:** End of 7th Semester (Exam Session).
*   **Format:** Pass/Fail. Presentation (usually scrolling through your PDF).
*   **Content (~10-15 pages):**
    *   Title Page.
    *   Introduction.
    *   Review of Similar Systems.
    *   General Architecture + Diagram.
    *   Objectives & Requirements.
*   **Reviewer:** The professor leading the "Bachelor Graduation Thesis 1" course.

### 4. Development Phase (February - April)
*   **Advice:**
    *   Keep your supervisor updated **every 2 weeks**.
    *   **Demo Presentations:** Start around March/April (every 2 weeks). You must show progress (code/implementation).
    *   **Warning:** Don't leave the technical part for April.

### 5. "IoT Systems" / Coursework Defense (April 30th)
*   **What is it?** A course in the 8th semester that is essentially a "mini-defense" of your diploma's practical part.
*   **Deliverable:** A coursework report (~20-25 pages) based on your diploma's practical work (excluding the heavy theory/intro).
*   **Defense:** Presentation of the practical implementation.

### 6. BD2 - Bachelor Defense 2 (Early May)
*   **Timing:** ~May 9th.
*   **Status:** ~70-80% of work should be done.
*   **Content (~40-45 pages):**
    *   Everything from BD1 + Theory + Implementation details.
    *   Technical part should be mostly working.
*   **Format:** 7-minute presentation.
*   **Reviewers:** Your reviewer + potentially others (e.g., Darius).

### 7. Final Submission & Defense (Late May - Early June)
*   **Submission:** ~May 30th (5 working days before defense).
    *   Upload ZIP to Mano VGTU.
*   **Reviews:**
    1.  **Supervisor Review:** Usually positive.
    2.  **Reviewer (Recenzentas) Review:** Critical. Contains a grade and **2-3 mandatory questions**.

## 📝 Diploma Structure & Formatting

**Standard Structure:**
1.  **Introduction** (3-5 pages).
2.  **Review of Similar Systems** (End this section with a **Comparison Table**).
3.  **System Architecture and Design** (Diagrams + High-level explanation).
4.  **System Development** (Implementation details).
5.  **Testing**.
6.  **Conclusions** (**Must contain numbers/metrics** - e.g., "System improved efficiency by 20%").
7.  **References**.
8.  **Appendices**.

**Formatting Rules:**
*   **New Pages:** Every Chapter (1., 2.) starts on a new page. Subchapters (1.1) do not.

## 📚 Course-Specific Advice (7th Semester)

### 🐧 Linux (Statkus)
*   **Difficulty:** Easy / Passable.
*   **Labs:** Can often be done with ChatGPT/Instructions.
*   **Attendance:** Not strict.
*   **Assessment:** Midterm/Exam involves practical tasks + theory.

### 🤖 Microcontrollers
*   **Lecturer:** Strict. Exam is a Moodle test (multiple choice), hard to cheat but possible (Alt-Tab skills).
