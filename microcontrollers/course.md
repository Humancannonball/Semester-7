Course title High Performance Microcontrollers
Course aim
To learn the high performance microcontrollers principles, analyze their characteristics, choose the high performance microcontroller for concrete application in the internet of things, develop and analyze programs and be able to substantiate solutions working individually or in the team.
Course description
In the context of high-performance microcontrollers, general knowledge is acquired about the purpose, characteristics, classification, functional nodes, programming, and utilization of high-performance microcontrollers in the Internet of Things. The ARM microcontroller family is studied, with a detailed analysis of a selected representative from the ARM microcontroller family. Knowledge is gained about its characteristics, hardware components, tools used for program editing, and their application in modeling work. Theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the development of programs for the studied high-performance microcontroller are acquired. Students must complete in classroom all of the scheduled laboratory works.
